# Person Attribute Recognition

This project aims to perform Person Attribute Recognition (PAR) using a pretrained model and fine tunned on downstream task. Below are the steps to set up and run the project.

## Requirements

Before running the code, install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Steps to Run the Project

### 1. Data Augmentation

Run the data augmentation script to preprocess and augment the training images:

train and val folder contain the image which will be augmented for further processing

```bash
python augmentation.py
```

### 2. Utility Functions

Execute the labels functions script which contains code to map label to augmented images and save in csv functions for the project:

```bash
python labels.py
```

### 3. Model Training

Train the model :


```bash
python train.py
```

### 4. Inference

Perform inference on the test data using the trained model:

```bash
python inference.py
```

## Summary

1. Augmentation of the training images was performed.
2. A pretrained model from Hugging Face was used.
3. The model was fine-tuned on the downstream task of Person Attribute Recognition (PAR).
4. The model was then tested on the provided test data.
